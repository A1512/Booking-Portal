logic of getting business service with discount:
	1. discount value > 0
	2. start date & end date >= current date
	3. while getting service, if dicount apply then that data should be sent to front-end
	4. display both price to user before & after discount
	5. if user go for booking & select payment then display discounted price.

TODO: 
	-> ask business to edit or add discount on service
